## Calculon - Earth's Greatest Calculating Unit

Calculon is scientific calculator webapp, built with React and JavaScript, designed to evaluate basic mathematical expressions.

Calculon utilizes the UseState() hook to store the operand and the solution.

Expressions are parsed through a formatting function prior to evaluation to prevent JavaScript errors, and the solution is updated with a setter function.
